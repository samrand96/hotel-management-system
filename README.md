**Hotel Management System Demonstration**

This repository is a state-of-the-art Hotel Management System, a project developed during the second stage of a Software Engineering program. It's a geeky showcase of modern web-based solutions combining Bootstrap, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, PHP, and MySQL, thoroughly implementing PHP Data Objects (PDO) to fortify against SQL injection.

-------------------
## Why It's Cool

- **Cutting-edge Tech**: Rocking Bootstrap, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, PHP, MySQL, and DataTables for ultra-smooth data presentations.
- **Resource Hoarding**: The `_assets` directory is a treasure trove, packed with essential CSS, images, and JavaScript assets—think jQuery SweetAlert2, DataTables—for an intuitive user experience.
- **Modular Mojo**: The `_include` directory is brimming with vital components such as the footer, header, and various modals, enhancing user interactions with flashy popups for actions like creating, editing, and deleting stuff.
- **Architectural Swagger**: Containers are superb, proper? This project boasts a killer VMC architecture, with specialized controller scripts handling page-specific JavaScript mojo and a centralized model that's a CRUD ninja.
- **DB Wizardry**: The SQL script gives you a peek into the database schema, helping you set up crucial tables for a hotel's operations.

--------------------------
## How to Geek Out with It

1. **Golden Rules**: Make sure your environment is PHP (7.x preferred) and MySQL-friendly. Set up a web server (Apache, Nginx) to get your PHP game going.
2. **Bring It Home**: Clone this repo and make it yours using `git clone.`
3. **DB Ups and Downs**: Run the SQL script to make magic happen with your database setup.
4. **Config Alert**: Don't forget to mingle with your database credentials in `dbconnection.php` within the `model` folder.
